      Due to the extended length of this trip, provide a highly structured but concise plan.
      1. **Detailed Template:** Provide 2-3 fully detailed sample days (e.g., "A Cultural Day in Paris", "A Day Trip to Versailles"). These should follow all content rules and serve as a template.
      2. **Thematic Overview:** For the remaining days, organize the itinerary by theme or region rather than by date. For each theme/region:
          - List the top 3-5 must-see attractions and experiences.
          - Suggest 2-3 highly recommended restaurants for that area.
          - Provide a logical route or grouping for these activities.
      3. **Flexible Structure:** Empower the user to mix and match these thematic blocks to build their own days. The goal is to provide the essential information and inspiration without a rigid, day-by-day breakdown for a full month.
